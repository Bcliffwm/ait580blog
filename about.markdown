This is the file where we talk about the motivation for this project, who we are, what data we are using, etc.

## Project Motivation
Drawing from our experiences living with the COVID-19 pandemic for more than 2 years, we wanted to study people's willingness to take preventative measures against
other common diseases such as flu, various forms of cancer, etc. 
## Dataset
The dataset we are using for this blog site comes from the CDC's preventative measures studies which is used to create a bar chart using their page's UI tools.
# Demographics
Our subjects are all U.S. citizens who are 65 years of age or older. Each subdivision of the data is broken down by geolocation/city where reporting occurs.
