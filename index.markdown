## Our Project
Drawing from our experiences living with the COVID-19 pandemic for more than 2 years, we wanted to study people's willingness to take preventative measures against
other common diseases such as flu, various forms of cancer, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset we are using for this blog site was created from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Population Level Analysis Community Estimates (PLACES) innitiative. The overall problem we would like to solve through data analysis is to illustrate the effectiveness of the CDC's efforts of informing the public regarding public health issues and preventative measures.

## Demographics
The subjects of the PLACES dataset we selected are all U.S. citizens who are 65 years of age or older. Each subdivision of the data is broken down by geolocation/city where reporting occurs.
