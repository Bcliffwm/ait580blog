## Project Motivation
Drawing from our experiences living with the COVID-19 pandemic for more than 2 years, we wanted to study people's willingness to take preventative measures against
other common diseases such as flu, various forms of cancer, etc. 
## Dataset
The dataset we are using for this blog site was created from the CDC's Population Level Analysis Community Estimates (PLACES) innitiative. The overall problem we would like to solve through data analysis is to illustrate the effectiveness of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) efforts of informing the public regarding public health issues and preventative measures.

## Data Curators
The CDC is a U.S. Government entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the citizens of the United States from any illness, virus or disease that poses a threat to our country's well-being. The members of the CDC often conduct scientific experiments, collect data, host and conduct public-health seminars all in order to make efforts to disseminate information to the public.

The purpose of PLACES was to provide information on a zip code-by-zip code basis, identify key health problems, develop localized plans moving forward, and differentiate the health threats affecting citizens living in various areas such as urban, rural or suburban areas.
## Demographics
Our subjects are all U.S. citizens who are 65 years of age or older. Each subdivision of the data is broken down by geolocation/city where reporting occurs.
