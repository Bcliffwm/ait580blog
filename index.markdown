## Our Story
In 2020, the world changed indefinitely. 

We are no longer living in the same world we used to live in prior to COVID-19. In the current post-pandemic era, Public Health has become a center-piece conversation on news channels, broadcasts, universities, and college campuses. The devastating effects of COVID19 still are felt now 2 years later. The big question remains…could we have predicted the pandemic?  

A few diseases similar to the COVID19: Dengue, Ebola, SARS, H1N1, and Zika are a few examples. Since 1980, more than 12,000 documented outbreaks have killed millions of people around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) detected outbreaks of six of the eight “priority diseases”, so would it be fair to say we weren’t warned? Even as we attend to the countless emergencies generated by COVID-19, we need to think deeply about why the international community was so unprepared for an outbreak that was so inevitable. This is hardly the first time we’ve faced global catastrophes.  

As graduate students studying Big Data, we wanted to explore a dataset that was based in the real world to answer this important question: How is real world data interpreted to gain more insight into estimating the impact and limitations of a particular health initiative?   

There are known COVID-19 infections that are present in 176 countries–making the pandemic the most significant threat to humanity since World War II [1]. Unlike the second world war, the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis had been anticipated by public health researchers. For years infectious disease specialists have been raising the alarm and spreading awareness about an outbreak. What were some of the limitations for their research–and data to be spread to the public?  

A big part of the limitations that we will touch on our project, is the lack of availability for consistent, clean data that can inform trend lines. We have chosen to explore data directly from CDC (Centers for Disease Control). As part of our graduate work, we will cover data from PLACES (Population Level Analysis Community Estimates), which is a collaboration between CDC, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the CDC Foundation [2]. PLACES provides us with health data for small areas across the country–which in turn, allows local health departments, and jurisdictions (regardless of population size and rurarility) to better understand the burden and geographic distribution of health measures in their respective areas while assisting them with planning public health interventions.  

The particular dataset that we have chosen will cover men and women aged 65 years and older who are ‘up-to-date’ with the recommended core set of clinical preventive services. The data we have explored provides model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease that are related to health outcomes and use of preventative services [3].

## Dataset
The dataset we are using for this blog site was created from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Population Level Analysis Community Estimates (PLACES) innitiative. The overall problem we would like to solve through data analysis is to illustrate the effectiveness of the CDC's efforts of informing the public regarding public health issues and preventative measures.

## Demographics
The subjects of the PLACES dataset we selected are all U.S. citizens who are 65 years of age or older. Each subdivision of the data is broken down by geolocation/city where reporting occurs.
