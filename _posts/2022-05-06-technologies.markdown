A Breakdown of the Technical requirements for this project: 

Code Environment:
We utilized the Visual Studio Code IDE as well as its Jupyter Notebook plugin to develop the code.  

Data Pre-Processing and Cleaning: 
We took in raw data from the CDC website and removed outliers, and zoomed into the columns that we needed to analyze 
The data reading and manipulations were mostly handled by the Pandas library, namely the unique dataframe object.  

Data Analysis:
The Hypothesis testing was conducted using the Scipy library in Python.   

Data Visualizations:
The Visualizations were created using the Plotly library and the geospatial visual used Plotly, Shapely, and GeoPandas.
