This is a bar graph showing the prevalence of men and women aged 65 years and older who are up-to-date with the recommended core set of clinical preventive services. This project provides model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch.

Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates.

This map shows all locations where the PLACES surveys took place. The majority of the survey calls were made in the states of California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and Michigan. The points colored in red on the map whereas everywhere is marked in blue.

What is notable about this observation in regards to the survey is that the majority of the US population seems to be concentrated in certain environments. If the probability of most chronic illnesses, diseases and viruses affecting the target population can be traced to the environment, then a potential bias surrounding these five states and their environments' characteristics may be affecting the PLACES survey efforts.
