## Questions
Given our dataset, we chose to address differences in participation of the PLACES survey between the two sexes. There were other considerations for our research such as assessing geographical differences of the PLACES survey locations. The problem with that specific idea is the dataset doesn't seem to include any rural or suburban areas despite one of the goals of the PLACES initative being able to differentiate the health problems across different environments. 

Comparing the sexes seems to be the least problematic given our dataset as there is an even distribution of men and women. What would be neat to see are differences between the male and female prevention rates to see if there is any causal or behavioral explanation to inspect.
