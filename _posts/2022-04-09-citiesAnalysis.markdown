This map shows all locations where the PLACES surveys took place. The majority of the survey calls were made in the states of California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and Michigan. What is notable about this observation in regards to the survey is that the majority of the US population seems to be concentrated in certain environments. If the probability of most chronic illnesses, diseases and viruses affecting the target population can be traced to the environment, then a potential bias surrounding these five states and their environments' characteristics may be affecting the PLACES survey efforts.
