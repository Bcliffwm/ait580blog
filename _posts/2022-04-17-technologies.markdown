# Hardware Requirements
We utilized laptops that run both Windows and macOS operating systems. To replicate this analysis, we recommend the machine has at least 16GB of Random Access Memory (RAM).

# Software Requirements
For our blog site deployment and source control, we used GitHub Pages and GitHub respectively. We built the site using Jekyll.  

The analysis portion of our blog was done in Python. We utilized the Visual Studio Code IDE as well as its Jupyter Notebook plugin to develop the code. The visualizations were created using the Plotly library and the geospatial visual used Plotly, Shapely, and GeoPandas. The Hypothesis testing was conducted using the Scipy library. Lastly, the data reading and manipulations were mostly handled by the Pandas library, namely the unique dataframe object.
