The analysis portion of our blog was done in Python. We utilized the Visual Studio Code IDE as well as its Jupyter Notebook plugin to develop the code. The visualizations were created using the Plotly library and the geospatial visual used Plotly, Shapely, and GeoPandas. The Hypothesis testing was conducted using the Scipy library. Lastly, the data reading and manipulations were mostly handled by the Pandas library, namely the unique dataframe object.
