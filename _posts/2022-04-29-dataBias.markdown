## Potential Bias
While exploring initial questions for this project, we discovered that the data we had from PLACES was not comprehensive enough, which we suspect will lead to potential bias. We highly recommend gathering additional data and conducting ‘Logistic Regression’ to analyze how the preventative measures correspond to immunization rates. A further study incorporating these components would help uncover more patterns regarding prevenative care measures across the country which would be highly beneficial to the CDC.

Looking into the very nature of the dataset, we can see where the bias might have originated, as participant data was collected over the phone. The default answer to each phone question could have been a “yes”, leading to a ‘false positive’ result in the preventative measure data. This reason alone may explain why the response rate or signal is relatively low (approximately 35% across all states and regions).
Some states such as California and Texas have staggeringly larger numbers of people participating per location, compared to low-participation rate states such as Alaska or North Dakota. While this trend should make logical sense if the motivation is to study as many people as possible, the consequence or potential source of bias manifests in the lack of representation of less populated areas of the country. To further emphasize this point, states like California and Texas that have higher populations and population densities than states such as Alaska or Wyoming, have cities with population sizes that far surpass the most populous cities in low population and low population density states. Hence, the lack of even distribution among states presents a potential ‘confirmation bias’ which makes our analysis inconclusive.

The state of Wyoming has one city surveyed with a population size ranging between 50,000 to 100,000 people, whereas Texas and California have 18 and 55 cities surveyed respectively within the same population range.
