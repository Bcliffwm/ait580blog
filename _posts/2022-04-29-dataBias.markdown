## Potential Bias
<img src="/ait580blog/assets/images/biasimage.jpeg" style="width=100px;height=220px">

We identified a few weaknesses of the dataset where bias may affect ongoing or future analysis predicated on this dataset and datasets curated in a similar fashion. 

First, this dataset is a survey over the phone to various participants across the country whose responses must all be 'yes' to every preventative measure the CDC outlines in its guidelines in order to be counted in the survey. For this reason alone, this may explain why the response rate or signal is relatively low (approximately 35% across all states and regions). 

Second, some states such as California and Texas have staggeringly larger numbers of participating locations than other states such as Alaska or North Dakota. While this trend should makes logical sense if the motivation is to study as many people as possible, the consequence or potential source of bias manifests in the lack of representation of less populated areas of the country. To further emphasize this point, states like California and Texas that have higher populations and population densities than states such as Alaska or Wyoming, have cities with population sizes that far surpass the most populous cities in low population and low population density states.

The state of Wyoming has one city surveyed with a population size ranging between 50,000 to 100,000 people, whereas Texas and California have 18 and 55 cities surveyed respectively within the same population range.
