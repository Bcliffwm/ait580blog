## Data Curators
As one of their goals entails disseminating information to the public, members of the CDC often conduct scientific experiments, collect data, host and conduct public-health seminars and place their results and data on their website. This centralization model makes finding specific information, research efforts and general inquiries easy to address.

## PLACES Motivation
The purpose of PLACES was to provide information on a zip code-by-zip code basis, identify key health problems, develop localized plans moving forward, and differentiate the health threats affecting citizens living in various areas such as urban, rural or suburban areas.

## Data Quality
The dataset we selected was nowhere near ready for analysis. The main focus of this dataset is targeting population groups in different geographic areas, but the data for the geolocations were nested inside of a data object in the form of strings. This made geospatial analysis impossible to conduct with our code as the dataset came downloaded, so there was plenty of data cleaning that had to be done.

Additionally, most of the metadata on the CDC's websites hardly explained any of the actual fields of the dataset we worked with. The methodology of the research seemed to explain more about the data rather than the dataset's own documentation which was rather unsettling if the CDC is determined to inform the public about health matters. However, having Bethlehem's expertise in healthcare made understanding the data easier, which made the analysis more straightforward.

We did not encounter any security protocols or identity authentications to acquire this dataset.
