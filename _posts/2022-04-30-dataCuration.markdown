## Data Curators
The CDC is a U.S. Government entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the citizens of the United States from any illness, virus or disease that poses a threat to our country's well-being. The members of the CDC often conduct scientific experiments, collect data, host and conduct public-health seminars all in order to make efforts to disseminate information to the public.

## PLACES Motivation
The purpose of PLACES was to provide information on a zip code-by-zip code basis, identify key health problems, develop localized plans moving forward, and differentiate the health threats affecting citizens living in various areas such as urban, rural or suburban areas.
